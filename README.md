The data comes from a indoor radon short-term measurement of 7 days. Using the Corentium Home radon detector, the 1-DAY value was recorded three times per day (morning, afternoon, and night). Morning was defined as 6:00 am - 8:00 am, afternoon was defined as 12:30 pm - 2:00 pm, night was defined as 8:00 pm - 10:00 pm. Aditionally, indoor temperature and relative humidity was recorded along with radon data.  

A code was assigned with a letter, P for Patrimonial house and M for Multifamiliares aparments. A number was assigned based on the image provided in this repository.
